Your task is to search the web and gather comprehensive information about recent soccer matches and upcoming games. Focus on accuracy and completeness.

Search for latest soccer news focusing on:
- EPL (English Premier League)
- MLS (Major League Soccer)
- La Liga
- Champions League
- World Cup
- Copa America

Use these ESPN schedules as starting points:
- Yesterday's matches: https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/{previous_date}
- Today's matches: https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/{current_date}

GATHER THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1. COMPLETED MATCHES:
   - Match RESULTS from yesterday ({previous_date_readable})
   - Match RESULTS from today ({current_date_readable}) that have ALREADY FINISHED
   - For each completed match include:
     * Teams and final score
     * Names of players who scored goals (goal scorers)
     * Venue/location
     * Any significant or interesting events:
       - Red cards (which player, what minute)
       - Yellow cards for key players
       - Goals scored in overtime/stoppage time
       - Hat tricks (player scoring 3+ goals)
       - Penalty kicks
       - Own goals
       - Comebacks or dramatic finishes
       - Debut goals or milestones
       - VAR decisions that changed the game
       - Injuries to key players

2. UPCOMING MATCHES:
   - Matches scheduled for today that have NOT started yet (check current time above)
   - Matches scheduled for tomorrow or soon
   - For each upcoming match include: teams, scheduled time (with timezone), competition

IMPORTANT TIME-BASED RULES:
- Current time is: {current_timestamp}
- If a match was scheduled for 2:30 PM ET and current time is 6:00 PM ET, that match is FINISHED - get the result
- Only list matches as "upcoming" if they haven't started yet based on current time
- Be thorough in checking match status and results

Provide your findings in a structured, detailed format with all the information you gathered. Include as much relevant detail as possible - another system will format this for end users.
