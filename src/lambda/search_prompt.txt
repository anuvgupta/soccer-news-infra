CURRENT TIME: {current_timestamp}

YESTERDAY: {previous_date_readable}

Your task is to search the web and gather comprehensive information about recent soccer matches and upcoming games. Focus on accuracy and completeness.

Search for latest soccer news focusing on:
- EPL (English Premier League)
- MLS (Major League Soccer)
- La Liga
- Champions League
- World Cup
- Copa America

IMPORTANT - USE THESE RELIABLE SOURCES FOR GOAL SCORERS:

RECOMMENDED SOURCES (in order of preference):
1. **ESPN Match Pages**: From the schedule page, click into individual match pages which show goal scorers
   - Format: https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/[id]
   - These pages have "Goals" section with player names and times
   
2. **BBC Sport Match Reports**: Search for "[Team A] vs [Team B] BBC Sport match report"
   - Format: https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/[match-id]
   - Very reliable for goal scorers and match events
   
3. **Official League Websites**:
   - Premier League: https://www.premierleague.com
   - La Liga: https://www.laliga.com
   - MLS: https://www.mlssoccer.com
   
4. **FlashScore/SofaScore**: Have detailed match statistics with verified goal scorers
   - FlashScore: https://www.flashscore.com
   - SofaScore: https://www.sofascore.com

PROCESS:
- Start with ESPN schedule to identify completed matches
- For each match, navigate to the ESPN match detail page or search for BBC Sport match report
- Extract goal scorers from these structured sources
- If you cannot find detailed information from these sources, explicitly state "Goal scorers not confirmed"

FINDING MATCH EVENTS (Red Cards, Penalties, VAR, etc.):

On ESPN Match Pages, check these sections in order:
1. **Match Commentary** (PREFERRED): Detailed play-by-play with all significant events
   - Shows red/yellow cards with player names and minutes
   - Indicates penalties awarded and outcomes
   - Notes VAR decisions and their impacts
   - Describes goals scored in stoppage time or dramatic moments
   
2. **Match Stats**: Shows cards and other statistics
   - Yellow/Red cards summary
   - Penalties statistics
   
3. **Match Timeline**: Visual timeline of key match moments
   - Goals, cards, substitutions with exact times

Other sources for events:
- **BBC Sport Match Reports**: Narrative descriptions of significant events
- **FlashScore/SofaScore**: Complete incident timelines with all match events

If significant events are not documented in these sources, write "No significant events reported"

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- ONLY report goal scorers and match events if you find them in one of the RECOMMENDED SOURCES above (ESPN, BBC Sport, official league sites, FlashScore/SofaScore)
- For ESPN matches, check Match Commentary (preferred), Match Stats, and Match Timeline for complete event details
- NEVER guess or infer who might have scored or what events occurred based on typical patterns
- NEVER use information from previous matches or training data
- If multiple sources conflict, state "Conflicting information found" rather than choosing one
- Include the specific source (ESPN Match Page/Commentary, BBC Sport, etc.) for each match report you use
- Prefer ESPN Match Commentary and BBC Sport as they are most reliable and detailed
- Cross-reference at least 2 sources when possible for completed matches
- If you cannot find verified goal scorer information from the recommended sources, write "Goal scorers not confirmed" instead of guessing
- If you cannot find verified event information, write "No significant events reported" instead of guessing

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Do NOT report player names or match events unless you found them in one of the RECOMMENDED SOURCES (ESPN, BBC Sport, official leagues, FlashScore/SofaScore)
- Do NOT use random websites, social media posts, or unreliable sources for goal scorer or event information
- Do NOT assume common players (like Bruno Fernandes, Salah, etc.) scored just because they often do
- Do NOT assume typical events (like "X team had a player sent off") without finding it in Match Commentary, Stats, or Timeline
- Do NOT mix up information from different matches
- Do NOT use your training data - ONLY use current web search results from the recommended sources above
- Do NOT report goal scorers or events from news headlines that don't provide specific details

ESPN schedules (use these to identify which matches happened):
- Yesterday's matches: https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/{previous_date}
- Today's matches: https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/{current_date}

After identifying completed matches from schedules, search for each match's detailed report.

GATHER THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1. COMPLETED MATCHES:
   - Match RESULTS from yesterday ({previous_date_readable})
   - Match RESULTS from today ({current_date_readable}) that have ALREADY FINISHED
   
   REQUIRED FORMAT FOR EACH COMPLETED MATCH:
   Match: [Team A] vs [Team B]
   Score: [X-Y]
   Date: [Actual match date]
   Source: [Specify which: ESPN Match Page, BBC Sport, Official League Site, FlashScore, or SofaScore]
   Goal Scorers: [Names and times, or "Not confirmed" if not found in recommended sources]
   Key Events: [Events with details, or "None reported" if not found]
   
   For each completed match include:
     * Teams and final score
     * Source where you found the match information (ESPN Match Commentary, ESPN Stats, ESPN Timeline, BBC Sport, etc.)
     * Names of players who scored goals with times (ONLY if verified in source)
     * Venue/location
     * Any significant or interesting events found in Match Commentary, Stats, or Timeline:
       - Red cards (which player, what minute) - Check Match Commentary/Timeline
       - Yellow cards for key players - Check Match Stats
       - Goals scored in overtime/stoppage time - Check Match Commentary
       - Hat tricks (player scoring 3+ goals) - Check Match Commentary/Stats
       - Penalty kicks (awarded, scored/missed) - Check Match Commentary
       - Own goals - Check Match Commentary
       - Comebacks or dramatic finishes - Check Match Commentary
       - Debut goals or milestones - Check Match Commentary/Reports
       - VAR decisions that changed the game - Check Match Commentary
       - Injuries to key players - Check Match Commentary

2. UPCOMING MATCHES:
   - Matches scheduled for today that have NOT started yet (check current time above)
   - Matches scheduled for tomorrow or soon
   - For each upcoming match include: teams, scheduled time (with timezone), competition

IMPORTANT TIME-BASED RULES:
- Current time is: {current_timestamp}
- If a match was scheduled for 2:30 PM ET and current time is 6:00 PM ET, that match is FINISHED - get the result
- Only list matches as "upcoming" if they haven't started yet based on current time
- Be thorough in checking match status and results

Provide your findings in a structured, detailed format with all the information you gathered. Include as much relevant detail as possible - another system will format this for end users.

CRITICAL: For each completed match, you MUST search for and include:
- The actual player names who scored (e.g., "Saka scored in the 23rd minute") ONLY if found in ESPN Match Commentary, Stats, Timeline, or other verified sources
- Key events that happened (red cards, penalties, VAR, etc.) ONLY if found in ESPN Match Commentary, Stats, Timeline, or other verified sources
- The specific source section where you found the information (e.g., "ESPN Match Commentary", "BBC Sport Match Report")
- If you cannot find detailed goal scorer information after checking these sections, write "Goal scorers not confirmed"
- If you cannot find significant events after checking these sections, write "No significant events reported"
- DO NOT just list scores without attempting to find player and event information from the recommended sources
- BETTER TO SAY "Not confirmed" or "Not reported" THAN TO GUESS OR USE UNVERIFIED INFORMATION
