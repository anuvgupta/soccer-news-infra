Your task is to find detailed information about specific soccer matches: WHO scored the goals and WHAT significant events occurred.

You will receive a list of completed matches WITH their ESPN match page URLs.

USE ESPN MATCH PAGES ONLY:
- You will be given the direct URLs to each match page
- Format: https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/[id]
- Navigate to each URL and check these sections:
  * **Game Story / gameStory** (PREFERRED for narrative summary): Key events and highlights in story format
  * **Match Commentary**: Detailed play-by-play with all events
  * **Match Stats**: Cards and penalties summary  
  * **Match Timeline**: Visual timeline of key moments

FOR EACH MATCH URL PROVIDED, FIND:

**Goal Scorers:**
- Player names who scored
- Minute of each goal
- Check: ESPN Game Story (preferred), Match Commentary, Match Stats, or Timeline

**Significant Events:**
- Red cards (player name, minute) - Check Game Story, Match Commentary, or Timeline
- Yellow cards for key players - Check Game Story or Match Stats
- Penalty kicks (awarded, scored/missed) - Check Game Story or Match Commentary
- Goals in stoppage time - Check Game Story or Match Commentary
- Hat tricks - Check Game Story, Match Commentary, or Stats
- Own goals - Check Game Story or Match Commentary
- VAR decisions that changed the game - Check Game Story or Match Commentary
- Dramatic comebacks or finishes - Check Game Story or Match Commentary

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY use the ESPN match page URLs provided
- Navigate to each URL and check Game Story, Match Commentary, Stats, and Timeline sections
- Prefer Game Story as it often has the best narrative summary of key events
- NEVER guess or infer based on typical players or patterns
- NEVER use training data - ONLY what you find on the ESPN match pages
- If you cannot find goal scorers on the ESPN page, write "Goal scorers not confirmed"
- If you cannot find significant events on the ESPN page, write "No significant events reported"
- Specify which ESPN section you found the info in (e.g., "ESPN Game Story", "ESPN Match Commentary", "ESPN Stats")
- Better to say "Not confirmed" than to guess

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Do NOT use any sources other than the ESPN match URLs provided
- Do NOT report player names unless found on the ESPN match page
- Do NOT assume common players scored
- Do NOT mix up information from different matches
- Do NOT search for other sources - stick to ESPN only

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each match, provide:

Match: [Team A] vs [Team B]
URL: [The ESPN match page URL you visited]
Source Section: [ESPN Game Story / ESPN Match Commentary / ESPN Stats / ESPN Timeline]
Goal Scorers: [Names with minutes, or "Not confirmed"]
Significant Events: [Details, or "No significant events reported"]

Be thorough but accurate. Only report information found on the ESPN match pages provided.
