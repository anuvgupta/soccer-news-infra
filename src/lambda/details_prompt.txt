Your task is to SEARCH and find detailed information about specific soccer matches: WHO scored the goals and WHAT significant events occurred.

This is NOT a template-filling exercise. You must perform actual web searches to find real data.

You will receive a list of completed matches WITH their ESPN match page URLs as references.

HOW TO SEARCH FOR INFORMATION:
- You will be given match details and ESPN URLs as references
- For each match, perform targeted searches like:
  * "Arsenal vs Aston Villa December 30 2025 goal scorers ESPN"
  * "Chelsea Bournemouth December 30 2025 match report ESPN"
  * "Newcastle Burnley red card December 30 2025 ESPN"
  
- ESPN match pages have these sections (use as search context):
  * **Game Story / gameStory**: Key events and highlights in story format
  * **Match Commentary**: Detailed play-by-play with all events
  * **Match Stats**: Cards and penalties summary  
  * **Match Timeline**: Visual timeline of key moments
  
- The provided URLs can help you find the right ESPN match pages, but search for the specific information you need

FOR EACH MATCH PROVIDED, SEARCH FOR:

**Goal Scorers:**
- Search query examples:
  * "[Team A] vs [Team B] [Date] goal scorers ESPN"
  * "[Team A] [Team B] who scored [Date]"
- Find: Player names who scored and minute of each goal
- Look in: ESPN Game Story (preferred), Match Commentary, Match Stats, or Timeline

**Significant Events:**
- Search query examples:
  * "[Team A] [Team B] red card [Date] ESPN"
  * "[Team A] [Team B] penalty [Date] ESPN"
  * "[Team A] [Team B] VAR decision [Date]"
- Find:
  * Red cards (player name, minute)
  * Yellow cards for key players
  * Penalty kicks (awarded, scored/missed)
  * Goals in stoppage time
  * Hat tricks
  * Own goals
  * VAR decisions that changed the game
  * Dramatic comebacks or finishes

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use web search to find information from ESPN match pages
- The URLs provided are helpful references to find the right match pages
- Search specifically for each piece of information (goal scorers, events, etc.)
- Prefer ESPN sources (Game Story, Match Commentary, Stats, Timeline)
- NEVER guess or infer based on typical players or patterns
- NEVER use training data - ONLY what you find through current web searches
- If you cannot find goal scorers after searching, write "Goal scorers not confirmed"
- If you cannot find significant events after searching, write "No significant events reported"
- Specify which ESPN section/source you found the info in (e.g., "ESPN Game Story", "ESPN Match Commentary")
- Better to say "Not confirmed" than to guess

ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - DO NOT USE PLACEHOLDERS:
- DO NOT use placeholders like "[Player Name]", "[Minute]", "[Team]", etc.
- DO NOT create template-like output with brackets
- DO NOT say "placeholders should be replaced" - either find the real data or say "Not confirmed"
- If you cannot find the actual player name, write "Goal scorers not confirmed" instead of "[Player Name]"
- If you cannot find the actual minute, omit it or say "time not specified"
- Using placeholders is considered FAILING the task

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Do NOT use sources other than ESPN (prioritize ESPN in your searches)
- Do NOT report player names unless found through web search of ESPN match pages
- Do NOT assume common players scored
- Do NOT mix up information from different matches or dates
- Do NOT use training data or make assumptions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each match, provide:
