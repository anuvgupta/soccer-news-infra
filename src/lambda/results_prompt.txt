TODAY: {current_date_readable}
YESTERDAY: {previous_date_readable}

Your task is to find completed and upcoming soccer match results from ESPN. Keep this simple and focused - just get the scores and match URLs.

Focus on these competitions:
- EPL (English Premier League)
- MLS (Major League Soccer)
- La Liga
- Champions League
- World Cup
- Copa America

USE ESPN SCHEDULES:
- Yesterday's matches: https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/{previous_date}
- Today's matches: https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/{current_date}

From these schedule pages, navigate to each match to get the ESPN match page URL.
Match page URLs are in format: https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/[id]

WHAT TO FIND:

1. COMPLETED MATCHES (Results Only):
   - Matches from yesterday ({previous_date_readable})
   - Matches from today ({current_date_readable}) that have ALREADY FINISHED (check current time)
   
   For each completed match provide:
   - Team names
   - Final score
   - Competition/league
   - Date
   - ESPN Match Page URL (IMPORTANT: extract this from the schedule page)

2. UPCOMING MATCHES:
   - Matches scheduled for today that have NOT started yet
   - Matches scheduled for tomorrow or soon
   
   For each upcoming match provide:
   - Team names
   - Scheduled time (with timezone)
   - Competition/league

TIME-BASED RULES:
- Current time is: {current_timestamp}
- If a match was scheduled for 2:30 PM ET and current time is 6:00 PM ET, that match is FINISHED
- Only list as "upcoming" if the match hasn't started yet

OUTPUT FORMAT:
List all completed matches with their scores and ESPN URLs, then list upcoming matches.
Keep it simple - just teams, scores, URLs, and times. No need for goal scorers or events yet.

Example:
COMPLETED MATCHES:
- Arsenal 4-1 Aston Villa (EPL, December 30)
  URL: https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/704329
- Newcastle 3-1 Burnley (EPL, December 30)
  URL: https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/704330

UPCOMING MATCHES:
