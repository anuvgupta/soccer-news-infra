I want you to create aws infrastructure for a soccer news app. But first, lets plan.

We have the following requirements:
- We should get a notification each day at 9am
    - The first thing in the notification is the headline: a brief summary (should fit in a standard iphone notification box without needing to open the notification further) of the top highlights for soccer at that current exact time/day of the notification. For now, top highlights should be related only to English premier league (EPL), MLS (US major league soccer), la liga (spain), and major competitions (World Cup, euro cup, copa america, Champions league, club world cup). And the subject of the highlights should primarily focus on results of matches from previous day and list of upcoming matches. If that is a too much information to fit in the notification box, just keep it concise and mention only the most important news ie. significant wins and knockouts.
    - After the summary there should be 3 line breaks followed by a longer description covering all the highlights of the day, including the longer form of whats covered in the headline, and the other things that were lower priority and not included in the headline. It can be split into sentences, and sentences that are not about the same topic should be spaced out by 2 line breaks. It should be no longer than 7 sentences.

For the design:
- We can use an eventbridge schedule to trigger a lambda every day at 9am.
- The lambda should call openai api with web search tool enabled. If possible the lambda should specify to the sdk/api to use a deep thinking mode/model from the openai API since we need the model to perform several steps from one prompt.
        - THe lambda should prompt the api with a standard prompt that we can store in the code for now. THe prompt should instruct the llm to search the web for the highlights referred to above, regarding soccer/football (not american football) for the last 24 hrs (results & news) and upcoming games/events. The prompt can advise the llm to use these websites for the summary of yesterday and today's games: previous day schedule https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/20251228 and current day schedule https://www.espn.com/soccer/schedule/_/date/20251229 . For more details and news, prompt can advise the LLM to check ESPN, BBC sports, leagues's individual websites for epl and mls and la liga, reddit (r/footballhighlights and other sports subreddits). Finally, the prompt should instruct the LLM to create the notification headline and the 7-sentences-max description using the guidelines mentioned above.
- The lambda should then publish the message to an SNS topic
